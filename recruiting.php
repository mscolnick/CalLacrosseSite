    <h4 class="top-title">Playing at Cal</h4>
    <div class="well well-lg">
      <p>Cal is considered the #1 public university in the country and the #3 global university. We have 7 Nobel Prize winners and 77 Fullbright Scholars on our faculty and 276 degree programs from which to choose. Adding to that: a beautiful campus in the Berkeley hills overlooking the San Francisco Bay, in close proximity to cities of culture, beaches, hiking and biking trails; a fun, vibrant social life; the energy and excitement of PAC-12 Athletics; and you have a home run college experience.</p>
      <p>Since our players are highly motivated students and want to enjoy other aspects of the UC Berkeley experience, the goal of the program is to do everything a DI program does (Fall Ball, strength and conditioning, film study, etc.) so we're in position to compete for WCLL and MCLA Championships, while being extremely efficient with our time so as to attain the perfect balance to the college experience.</p>
      <p>We play our games in historic Memorial Stadium, and we practice right next door on newly refurbished Maxwell Field.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in Cal and want to open up the lines of communication, please fill out our questionnaire below. Applicants should have an unweighted GPA of 3.9 or higher, a SAT score of 2100+, an ACT score of 31+, and prepare an insightful, well-written essay to impress our admissions staff.</p>
