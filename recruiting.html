                        <p>At UC-Berkeley you will get an elite education at the #1 public university in the world while having the opportunity to play lacrosse in an NCAA-modeled program.<br>
                        <br>
                        The main difference between Cal Lacrosse and DI Lacrosse: time. The goal of this experience is to be professional while we're on the field, in the weight room and in the film room, but to also be efficient with our time. We never want lacrosse to feel like a job at Cal. Practices will be ninety minutes, up tempo and competitive. We step on the field and we get after it. In the end, our ultimate goals for Cal Lacrosse players are to excel in the classroom, to get our degree, earn the job and the life we've always dreamed of, to win Championships, and have tons of fun on and off the field in the process. It is an achievable balance at Cal.<br>
                        <br>
                        On top of all that, add in our beautiful location, easy access to cities of culture like San Francisco and Oakland, the beaches, the bay, hiking and biking trails, and the energy, excitement and spirit of Pac-12 Athletics, and Cal Lacrosse is a home run college experience.<br>
                        <br>
                        If interested in communicating with Coach Ned Webster, please email him at <a href="nedwebster@berkeley.edu">nedwebster@berkeley.edu</a> after filling out our questionnaire below.</p>

              In short, the answer is not really. As a club team, we have little effect on admissions. Our coach is able to write a finite number of "talent letters" which are tagged to certain applicants. However, these talent letters act as a tie-breaker between applicants and not a sure-fire method to get admitted. Grades, SAT scores, and extracurriculars rule the admissions world. Keep in mind that playing lacrosse (or any sport for that matter) is a great display of commitment and is a positive with the admissions office. With that being said, if you are interested in playing lacrosse at Cal we encourage you to fill out the recruiting form and contact our head coach.

            No. While club lacrosse is the highest level of collegiate lacrosse at Berkeley and the entire west coast, the team is entirely self-funded and does not sponsor players. The exception is the Doug Sciutto Memorial Scholarship. This scholarship is awarded every year to two seniors who have shown exceptional commitment to the Cal Lacrosse program.

              The Cal lacrosse team accepts players of all levels. There are no tryouts and we will take guys with no experience. Keep in mind that the team competes on a national level and most of the starters have significant experience. However, players have come in as freshmen with no experience and become significant contributors by their junior & senior year. Hard work and commitment can go a long way.

              In the fall (offseason), we usually practice MWF from 4-6pm. The fall season typically runs from September through November. In addition to practice, we lift as a team 2-3 days per week. We also have a couple of scrimmages in the fall against local opponents. Commitment in the fall is roughly 10 hours/week.
              <br>
              In the spring, we usually practice Monday-Friday from 4-6pm. We also continue to lift 2 days/week as a team. All players are also expected to attend any team meetings and film sessions.

            Travel in the fall is limited to day trips to local teams. The exception is a semi-annual (every other year) trip to Las Vegas for a tournament.
<br>
In the spring, we usually have 6-8 away games. Most of these games are against WCLL opponents and are day bus trips. However, we typically travel 2-3 weekends out of the season to play out of league opponents. In the past, we have made weekend trips to UCLA and Oregon. For more details, check out our <a href="http://mcla.us/teams/california_berkeley/2012/schedule.html"> schedule. </a><br>
Finally, Cal is always competing for a spot at the MCLA National Tournament. This past season (2012), the team travelled to Greenville, SC in May. This tournament is almost always after academic finals and does not conflict with school.

              Because we are a club sport and receive limited to no funding from the University, dues are usually around $800 in Fall and $1200 in Spring. Dues include coaches, equipment, travel costs, league fees, referees, fields, etc. In order to keep our dues as low as they are, all members of the team are required to contribute to fundraising efforts. Team officers will work with anyone with financial hardships on an individual basis.

              This is an unfortunate side effect of being a club sport. We do not have priority registration and some classes will inevitably conflict with practice. We encourage all players to do their best to schedule classes around the 4-6PM practice block but do understand that some conflicts are unavoidable. As Berkeley students, academics remain a top priority and we will do everything to encourage success in the classroom as well as on the lacrosse field.
