                                <p>Cal Lacrosse is pleased to announce that Ned Webster is the new Head Coach of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Men's Lacrosse program.<br>
                                <br>
                                Coach Webster&nbsp;comes to Cal after nine years as Head Coach for Dominican University. During&nbsp;his&nbsp;tenure at Dominican, Coach Webster transformed a winless club into a nationally ranked NCAA program, led his team to back-to-back WILA Championships in 2013 and 2014, and was twice named WILA Coach of the Year. Coach Webster managed all aspects of the Men's Lacrosse program including recruiting, player development, scouting, competitive&nbsp;strategy, fundraising, and program development.</p>

                                <p style="margin: 1em 0px;padding: 0px;color: #606060;line-height: 22.5px;font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 15px;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;text-align: left;">Coach Webster is steeped in Lacrosse tradition; he played high school lacrosse at Boys Latin in Baltimore and collegiate lacrosse at the University of Notre Dame. His father Mickey Webster is in the NCAA Hall of Fame and won two National Championships with Johns Hopkins, his brothers played lacrosse at University of North Carolina and University of Virgina.<br>
                                <br>
                                "I am honored and excited to be a part of UC Berkeley and help build on fifty years of Cal Lacrosse tradition," says Coach Webster. "Cal is one of the best overall college experiences available, with outstanding academic programs and faculty, a beautiful campus and location, high profile athletics, and tons of school spirit. I can't wait to be a part of it and recruit top notch young men to Berkeley. Of the players, alumni, and parents I've had the pleasure of meeting so far, they have proven that Cal truly does attract some of the best and brightest people on the planet, and I will work hard to make them all happy and proud of Cal Lacrosse."</p>

                                Coach&nbsp;Webster was the unanimous selection of the Head Coach Hiring Committee which included player, parent, alumni, and University representatives. Coach Webster was also the&nbsp;top candidate of Coach Emeritus Dan Nourse and Associate Head Coach Brian&nbsp;Ledyard, who both&nbsp;remain trusted advisers to Coach Webster.<br>
                                <br>
                                Tyler Kreitz, alumni representative to the hiring committee, says of Coach Webster, "I knew going into the interviews that Ned's work at Dominican was incredible, both on the field and off. After the first interview you could tell that he was the perfect man to lead Cal Lacrosse into its next phase of development. He had every aspect of the job- recruiting, coaching, development, university relations- everything, planned. I'm excited to support him and the team going forward- as I'm sure many of our alumni are."<br>

                                Thank you to all the fans, supporters, players, coaches, and alumni&nbsp;who have helped bring us to this point. The solid candidates interviewed during the Head Coach selection process are a testament to our strong&nbsp;community and its excitement about the future of Lacrosse at Cal.

                                <h4 class="media-heading">Cal vs. Florida</h4>On a crisp march night with the Cal Band blaring from the sidelines the Bear’s lacrosse team faced off against the Florida Gators. Tom Riis easily wins the first faceoff and the first goal comes equally as fast for the Bears but the Gators are quick to answer with two of their own. Seconds before the end of the first quarter Sam Schloemer is able to tie up the score 2-2 with a far pipe zinger. The bears started the second quarter with a quick man up goal and use the momentum to go on a wild run. Attack and midfield threats including Hayden, Sheehan, Riis and shore pick apart Florida’s defense putting up four more goals while the Bear’s close defense and LSMs stomped any of the Gator’s offensive hope with numerous take-aways and teeth-clenching hits allowing the bears to close the out the half 7-2. Due to the tireless advertising the Bears saw its largest crowd of the season packed into Memorial stadium as lacrosse enthused youth from all over the bay area came to see the Bears play and form a on the field 50 at half time, honoring the fiftieth anniversary of Cal Men’s Lacrosse. The Bears remained ever dominant during the second half, scoring 7 more goals to Florida’s 2, shutting down multiple man-down opportunities and playing fundamental lacrosse across the board. Offensive control along with defensive supremacy allowed the Bear’s to close out the evening on top, 14-4 in what was arguably the Bear’s best performance to date.<br>

                                <h4 class="media-heading">Cal vs. UCSB</h4>The Bears opened their game against the #6 ranked Gauchos with a bang and jumped out to an early 3-0 lead thanks to excellent face off work by Tom Riis. The warm weather of Memorial Stadium saw one of the largest crowds yet for the Bears this season and the game got much closer when the defense for Cal struggled in the second quarter. Flashes of brilliance like Sean Hayden scoring a behind the back goal on a fast break were not enough to overcome multiple penalties by the Bears that helped UCSB take a 9-6 lead into the locker rooms at halftime. Cal refused to give up the fight however and the defense battened down the hatches in the second half with a notable two minute non-releasable penalty kill where the Gauchos did not score. Multiple goals by freshman Max Mckone, Nick Sheehan, and Austin Shore combined with outstanding saves from goalie Sam Stowe to push the game down to the last minutes of the fourth quarter. The Gauchos were able to withstand the onslaught though and outlasted the Bears 13-11 to take their sixth consecutive win. Cal is now looking forward to two games next weekend against University of San Diego and Cal Poly.<br>

                                <h4 class="media-heading">Pac 12 Tournament</h4>The Bears went down to LA, shepherded south on a traffic-heavy Friday night by the incomparable and karaoke-crazy Carlos, to take part in the annual two-day Pac-12 Shootout hosted by UCLA. All coaches managed to make it down for the games, and after an early team meeting and breakfast on Saturday, the Bears went to the fields to play the Oregon State Beavers. From the start, things looked good for the Bears, with Tommy Riis and Nick Sheehan racking up plenty of points to close the half with a lead, which the Bears maintained until, behind by 2 goals late in the third quarter, the Beavers scored 5 unanswered goals to win the game 11-8. The most telling statistic of the game: the Bears turned the ball over on more than half of their possessions. But it stands as a testament to the chemistry of the team and the leadership of the coaches that the spirits were kept high and the focus turned towards the next day's game against Washington. Losing has a way of taking the wind out of one's sails, even in the Santa Ana breezes of Los Angeles, but the sting was put into perspective by a season-ending knee injury suffered by one of the Beaver's--we are, regardless of the results, lucky to play. The wonderful team parent network treated the team to a great dinner on Saturday night, and it did the trick because the next day the Bears beat the University of Washington Huskies 16-10. The Bears took it to Washington with a big win lead by Bear's goalie Bert Schmickel and the threatening attack line Nick Sheehan, Sean Hayden, and Sam Schloemer. After the long weekend, the Bears loaded back onto the bus and headed back to Berkeley. They stand at 2-1 this season and will play UC Santa Barbara this Sunday, February 23rd, at 1:00 pm in Memorial Stadium.<br>

                                This year's Pac 12 Tournament also marked the first So Cal regional alumni gathering. Greg Guy '03 and Teo Van Runkle '10 hosted an alumni cocktail hour at Teo's home in Venice. We joined the team and parents for a fun dinner at Bucco De Beppo and continued on to the Daily Pint in Santa Monica. The alumni and The Parietti family (Adam Parietti '15) also co-hosted a post game cookout for the team, family and alumni after the win over Washington on Sunday afternoon. There was a great showing of alumni including Zach Todaro, Sam Harvey, David Massey, Jake Zim, Brian McKone, Rob Shen, Michael Branch, Scott Brion and others. It was a great weekend and we look forward to continuing to connect our alumni community with other social and professional networking events in the months and years ahead.

                                <h4 class="media-heading">Cal vs. Chico - Home Opener</h4>The University of California Golden Bears started their season off roaring, proving that they did anything but hibernate this winter. Rain poured down as the Bears physically dominated the Chico State Wildcats on both sides of the ball, ultimately clinching a 10-3 victory. In typical fashion, the Wildcats yelled their way through a spirited warm up, and entered the first quarter motivated. They took an early lead, but an early goal on a late slide would be their only in the first half. The Bears quickly fired back, and showed that they would be the dominating force for the rest of the game. Attackmen Sean Hayden and Nick Sheehan headed up the offensive effort. The pair had tacked on nine out of the ten total goals, with the sole other coming from Junior Midfielder Sandy McNaughton. Between the lines play was fast and intense, as Tom Riis and Max McKone dominated face offs and battered the opposition at every turn. Senior Captain Eric Soenksen, who had several major takeaways, held down the defense. Sam Stowe played lights out in the cage, and appeared to be an impenetrable wall. The discomfort of the Chico State attackmen was palpable as a constant barrage of stick checks and little chance of squeaking the ball past Stowe dampened their spirits.<br>

                                After the final whistle blew the team collected in the locker room for an electric post game speech by Coaches Rutherford, Nourse, and Ledyard. Amongst the comments made was that the team had to take the field with a hunger for scrap with eyes consistently set on victory. The team certainly exhibited that on Saturday night, and christened Memorial Stadium in fine form for the 50th year of Cal Mens Lacrosse.<br>

                                <h4 class="media-heading">Cal Lacrosse Big Game Weekend</h4>This year's Cal Lacrosse Big Happy Hour was a great afternoon with alumni, players and coaches gathering for food and drink at Schroder's SF. This year's event was particular exciting as it marked the announcement of the Campaign for Cal Lacrosse Coach's Fund, a project to help take Cal Lacrosse to the next level of competitive success. We raised over $16,000 on Friday alone! Thanks to everyone who stepped up, it was really inspiring to see participation from so many young alumni. <a href="donate.html">Click here to learn more and make a gift.</a><br>

                                On Sunday, we had a beautiful Berkeley day for the alumni lacrosse game. It was a great family event with representation of players, parents, coaches, alumni, and alumni family. It was fun to get a few good runs up and down the field and so nice to see so much of the Cal Lacrosse family all together.<br>

                                The team will be working on fitness and strength over the winter in preparation for the spring MCLA season. This will be a special year as it is the 50th anniversary of the Cal Men's Lacrosse program. We look forward to seeing you at a game next year.<br>

                                Happy Holidays, and Go Bears!

The Bears played the University of Nevada, Reno Wolfpack, the Santa Rosa Junior College Bear Cubs, and the Chico State Wildcats. Over the three game tournament the combined score for Cal was 36-4 with 11-3, 15-0, and 10-1 victories respectively. The Bears dominated ground balls in all three games and the clearing game was rarely broken by any of the opponents.
