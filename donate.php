        <h3>Three ways to support Cal Lacrosse:</h3>
        <p>
          <b>The Annual Fund</b> is the lifeblood of the program; covering the costs of travel, gear, league fees, refs and everything else it takes to run the program day in and day out.
          <br>
          <b>The Campaign for the Coach's Fund</b> Thank you to everyone who helped Cal Lacrosse reach our $250,000 goal and hire Head Coach Ned Webster. Coach Webster began in June 2014, becoming the first full time Head Coach in the program's history.
          <br>
          <b>The Doug Sciutto Memorial Endowment</b> is part of our ongoing goal to endow Lacrosse forever. A percentage of your donation, in the form of annual return, becomes available to the team for the current season. This endowment is designed for larger gifts and planned giving.

        <h3>Annual Fund</h3>
        <p>Cal Lacrosse is a Club Sports team receiving less than 2% of the annual budget from the University. The Annual Fund is the lifeblood of the program; covering the costs of travel, gear, league fees, refs and everything else it takes to run the program day in and day out. Donations of any amount are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support!</p>

      <h3>Campaign for Coach's Fund</h3>
      <p>Completed in Spring 2014, this successful campaign has made it possible to hire a full time Head Coach. Ned Webster brings over 10 years of coaching experience to Cal and will lead Men's Lacrosse into the 2014/15 season and beyond. Bringing on a full time Head Coach with increased capacity to recruit, scout, game plan and build team culture will improve competitive success, securing Cal's future as a premier collegiate lacrosse program. Thank you to all the alumni, parents, and alumni parents and supporters who help us reach our goal!
