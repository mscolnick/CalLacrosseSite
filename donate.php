                    <b>The Campaign for the Coach's Fund</b> is an initiative to hire a full time Head Coach.
                    <br>
                    <b>The Doug Sciutto Memorial Endowment</b> is part of our ongoing goal to endow Lacrosse forever. A percentage of your donation, in the form of annual return, becomes available to the team for the current season. This endowment is designed for larger gifts and planned giving.

                <h3>Campaign for Coach's Fund</h3>

                <p>The goal of this project is to hire a full time Head Coach to begin the 2014/15 season. Bringing on a full time Head Coach with increased capacity to recruit, scout, game plan and build team culture will improve competitive success, securing Cal's future as a premier collegiate lacrosse program. The current goal is to raise $250,000 in order to hire a new coach for the 2014/15 season. Join alumni, parents, and alumni parents and help us reach our goal!</p>

                <h3>Annual Fund</h3>
                <p>As a club sports team, we receive less than 2% of our annual operating budget from the university. Even with players paying $2000 a year, we need help from our supporters to cover operating costs, including transportation, equipment, recruiting and scholarships. Players work on campus and at Cal football games to help support the team, but still we must turn to our friends and families to help us play the sport we love. Donations of any amount are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support!</p>
